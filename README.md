# Transformation-Invariant-Self-Training

This repository provides the official PyTorch implementation of Transformation-Invariant Self-Training (Domain Adaptation for Medical Image Segmentation using Transformation-Invariant Self-Training).

TI-ST is initially proposed for semantic segmentation in the medical domain but can be adopted for any general-purpose image segmentation problem.

This method uses transformation-invariant highly-confident predictions in the target dataset by considering an ensemble of high-confidence predictions from transformed versions of identical inputs.
